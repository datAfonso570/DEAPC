    <h3>About Me:</h3>
    <p>We are ADM Inventories, a company created as part of an academic project at the Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto (ISEP) by three students sharing a common vision: to make inventory processes simpler, more efficient, and technology-driven.</p>

    <p>Our mission is to offer personalized inventory solutions tailored to the needs of companies of all sizes. From asset counting and organization to data digitization and analysis, ADM aims to modernize a traditional sector through innovation, precision, and reliability.</p>

    <p>Our project was born from the union of three complementary areas of knowledge – management, engineering, and technology – allowing us to tackle market challenges with a practical, results-oriented approach.</p>

    <p>We are committed to delivering excellent service, based on values such as transparency, professionalism, and continuous innovation.</p>
